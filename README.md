# artspace

artspace is an application developed for a Java Programming course in Java, JavaFX and MySQL.

The purpose of artspace is to create a digital space for artists to upload their work and interact with lovers of art interested in buying their work. Artists can upload their artwork with different information, including: the name of the piece, the medium used, the price of the piece, and a short description (optional). Buyers can search for artwork according to different criteria such as the artist's name, name of the piece, and medium as well as create their own galleries with different artists' work and name them. 

This project includes a landing page which requires existing users to sign in, a sign up page for new users, a search page for buyers to use, and a personal page for artists containing their artwork as well as one for buyers container their galleries. 

Artist and buyer data (username, password, email, first and last name), gallery data, and artwork data are stored using MySQL.
